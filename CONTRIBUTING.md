#### About Contributing
Join our discord server, you can apply for a contributor role if your contribution is useful.

##### When to contribute and when to fork instead?
Contributions will affect everyone using this API.
We really appreciate contributions, but we also appreciate forks.
It is great news to hear about forks, people building on top of our API to build something great!
Please do not contribute if your change will only benefit your server/product.
Make a fork instead!
FYI we also have a forker role on the discord server that you can apply for.

##### What to note when contributing?
* Contributions should be pull requested to the **dev** branch.
The master branch is only for releases.
* You will be credited for your change in the next update's changelog if your PR gets accepted.
* I am still the copyright holder of the project and the license remains the same, even if you contribute.
